<div>
    https://www.websocket.in let's you define an own websocket url which is in the form of:
    <br>
    <br>
    wss://connect.websocket.in/<strong>YOUR_CHANNEL_ID</strong>?room_id=<strong>YOUR_ROOM_ID</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note: While wss:// is supported, your jenkins instance might reject the connection.</strong>
    Make sure you have a valid certificate store path given and that the connection to the given host is trusted.
    Workaround (not recommended): use the unencrypted ws:// Url instead.
